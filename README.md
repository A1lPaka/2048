# 2048

<br>

#### A custom desktop version of the 2048 game built with Python and PySide6.

<br>

## Features

<br>

- Adjustable board size — play not only on the classic 4×4 grid

- Undo functionality — revert previous moves

- Overlay mode — the game window can stay always on top of other applications

- Custom UI, animations and sound effects

- Desktop-focused design

<br>

## Overlay Mode

<br>

One of the key features of this project is the overlay mode.

<br>

When enabled:

- the game window stays always on top

- mouse interaction is disabled

- the game is controlled entirely via keyboard

<br>

This allows playing 2048 while doing other tasks, without switching focus between windows.

<br>
